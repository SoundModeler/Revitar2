Finish VSTGUI 3.6 support
Finish modification to pick attack
Optimizations? Code cleanup?
Add knob for pitch bend range
More chord types?
Autoconf/Automake stuff
VST3?
VST2Wrapper?


Notes for myself re: autoconf and such follow
Needs to build makefile for VSTSDKs
Needs to be able to make multiple versions of the VST
Needs to be able to link to prebuilt VST libraries
Needs to be able to build without statically linked gcc and such
Needs to be able to accept custom paths for VSTSDK
Needs to be able to build VSTGUI seperately from the rest of the SDK (and all this implies)
Needs to be able to build VSTSDK dynamically.
Needs to be able to install VSTSDK to --prefix (because why not)
