Finish VSTGUI 3.6 support
Make project directory for netbeans projects
Touch up UI
Finish modification to pick attack
 - incorporate into existing settings somehow and use toggle to switch between
   old and new styles, mayhaps?
Optimizations? Code cleanup?
Add knob for pitch bend range (where?)
More chord types?
Autoconf/Automake stuff
VST3?
VST2Wrapper?
Mac/iOS support? (unlikely)
ARM builds?

Notes for myself re: autoconf and such follow
Needs to build makefile for VSTSDKs
Needs to be able to make multiple versions of the VST
Needs to be able to link to prebuilt VST libraries
Needs to be able to build without statically linked gcc and such
Needs to be able to accept custom paths for VSTSDK
Needs to be able to build VSTGUI with the rest of the SDK (and all this implies)
Needs to be able to build VSTSDK dynamically.
Needs to be able to install VSTSDK to --prefix (because why not)
Needs to be able to build documentation (not a high priority, though)
